project title: Watch this now!
 project description: An interactive website to keep track of shows and movies that you want to watch, are currently watching and have finished watching. YOu can add notes to show what shows you have enjoyed or not enjoyed. 

1. Our motivation for this project was to make an easier to read website, developed to show what movies, and Tv shows you were currently watching.

2. We built this project because we are all entertainment nerds, who thoroughly enjoy watching TV and Movies.

3. This website we've built solves the problem of having to go to many different websites to rate, find and watch TV/Movies

4. We learned that there are many API's out there for this type of project. Learned multiple files are what it takes for a website to be Interactive.

## Usage
Find any movie you are looking to watch by searching in the search bar in the top left corner. Upon searching, the website should pull up search results for said movie, click the "Save Icon" in the lower left of the movie panel, and it will add it to the "To be watched" list.

So you've started watching the Movie you've added? Awesome, let's click the eyeball eyecon in the bottom left corner of the Movies panel. That will push the movie over to "Watching list"

You've finished the Movie? Awesome job! Click the Check in the bottom left and it should move it to the "Watched" Catergory where you will be able to rate it.

Give that Movie a thumbs up or down on how you rated it! (It will disappear at the moment, we have different plans for this!)
